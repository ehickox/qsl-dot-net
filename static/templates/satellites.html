<h2>Satellite Images of the Earth's Surface </h2>
<h3>I capture these images by holding up my cellphone to my HT.  </h3>
<p>They are low quality because I do this indoors with a suboptimal antenna. I dream of one day having a more optimal setup with a NOAA band pass filter. Hopefully I can do this before APT satellites become a thing of the past. NOAA-15 is already on its last leg.</p>
<p>Here is an image from NOAA-18.</p>
