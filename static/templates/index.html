    I have a very basic UHF/VHF setup with a few HTs, and a portable QRP HF rig.
    I like to go to local parks and hills to see who I can contact.
    You might find me on 10m SSB or FT8. I have constructed a speaker wire dipole and it works really well on 10m. As I've gotten my General class license, I've also been experimenting
    with other antenna designs so you may find me on other bands as well.
    I've managed to make DX contacts with only 5-10 watts.
    My goal is to contact as many states and countries as possible, taking advantage of the peak of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle_25">Solar Cycle 25</a> while it lasts.
    I'm a member of the <a href="https://sfarc.org">San Francisco Amateur Radio Club (SFARC)</a>, the <a href="https://californiahistoricalradio.com/">California Historical Radio Society (CHRS)</a>, and, of course, the <a href="https://www.arrl.org/">American Radio Relay League (ARRL)</a>.
    My brother is <a href="https://www.qrz.com/db/KR4AMW">KR4AMW</a>. He lives in Georgia, and I live in California, so you have one brother on each coast to try and contact.

    I'm the developer of an amateur radio logging iOS app called eh Radio Logger. It's a simple app with large, chunky buttons designed for use with one hand in the field when doing POTA or SOTA operations. Click the banner image below to download it from the App Store.
