    I have a very basic UHF/VHF setup with a few HTs.
    I like to go to local parks and hills to see who I can contact.
    Lately I have also been dabbling in HF so you might find me on 10m SSB or FT8. I have constructed a speaker wire dipole and have it hung in a window. I've managed to make DX contacts with only 5-10 watts. My goal is to contact as many states and countries with this basic setup.
